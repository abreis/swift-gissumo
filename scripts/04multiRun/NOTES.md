- `00setup.sh` - This script generates many sets of Floating Car Data by incrementing a starting seed. All relevant parameters are settable in the first few lines.

- `01simulate.sh` - This script automates simulations based on FCD files. It creates a subfolder for each FCD, and stores the simulation log and stats files there. 

Be sure to provide an obstruction mask before running a long set of simulations.
