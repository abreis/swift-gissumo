Statistics Hooks
================
This is a list of availabe statistics hooks and what enabling each does.


* activeVehicleCount (interval)

  Prints how many vehicles are active. Good for verifying the density of vehicles on the road over time, as SUMO doesn't have a way of enforcing this.


* activeRoadsideUnitCount (interval)

  Prints how many roadside units are active.


* finalCityCoverageMap (end)

  Prints the final coverage map of the complete city.


* cityCoverageMapEvolution (interval)

  Prints the current coverage map of the complete city.


* beaconCounts (interval)

  Prints the number of packets with Beacon payloads being sent and received.


* finalRoadsideUnitCoverageMaps (end)

  Prints the coverage map of every roadside unit active at the end of the simulation.
